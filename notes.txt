My notes for the competition: 
-- 'text' column contain hasthags, which are related to 'location' or 'natural disaster' column. a good idea would be to select these hash tags and do some statistics on them.
-- sneaky variant: maybe using external api we can predict if in given area, on given time at specified data was a natural disaster --> this is cheating but it fits competitions rules (maybe it's to complicated, but just as a fun sidenote) 
-- maybe I should remove digits from hashtags as I don't think they contain important information. digits in hashtgas can mean that they are used for model numbering, date/time of event, it's durationor even in typos. these numbers are not descriptive enough to show that the tweet is about the disaster - the word is more important. 
-- there two fundamental ways to train a NN: you define the abstract of the object that you want to categorize and it will recognize the concrete implementation of that concept OR just throw a bunch of data and it will try to learn the abstract concept and all concrete examples that derive from that. I wanted to manually extract hashtags from training dataset and feed them as important token - but this is more time consuimg so it's better to just let NN figure it out by itself what tokens are important'
-- I think that I don't need 'location' column because I don't make any geographical analysis - I need to know if in given text was mentionated if there was described a disaster or not and the location of that disaster is useless. Also, it has ~34% of data missing. 
-- I can restore the keywords by hashtags (but how exactly I should do it?)
-- How should I compare how similar is my text to disaster? Levenstein's distance (seems stupid)? COSINE SIMILARITY (KRUTA)
-- My approach is to use lemmatization in order to analyse the tone of the tweet. More negative is the note --> more probable is it about natural disaster. But there are more approaches (which I think are better) - like for instance try to undersatnd how "literate" is the tweet. Majority of tweets about natural disaster are written by news agencies and so result in a more gramatically correct and more descriptive tweets. Would I analyse more the text, I would probably observe this thing so I need to keep that in mind. Also, why
